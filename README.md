#The software is designed to facilitate experiment logging and data recording for research purposes. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows researchers to log timestamps of various events during an experiment, while also capturing data from basic sensors such as the microphone, mouse, and keyboard. The software ensures accurate timestamp logging by converting the GMT timestamp to the Finnish time zone.
